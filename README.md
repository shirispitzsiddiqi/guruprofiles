Guru profiles (Decoding the Gurus)

The files here should allow you to reproduce my latent profile analysis of the Gurometer scores. The file "gurometer_scores.csv" is a lightly cleaned version of the spreadhseet shared by the DTG hosts. "gurucategories.csv" and "guruplot.png" are the output produced by this code if run as is.

## Note: 
The results change slightly depending on whether ratings provided by RK (n = 9) are included or excluded. The code provides instructions for running it both ways so you can see how this affects the results.
